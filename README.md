- Open a Terminal / Command Prompt <br>
- Windows: Press Win → type PowerShell → Enter <br>
- macOS: Press Cmd+Space → type Terminal → Enter <br>
- Linux: Open your preferred terminal 

 **Navigate to the project folder**
```bash
cd path/to/your/Reliant-ERP-CRM-Prototype
```
**Install dependencies inside the project folder(this downloads are required for libraries)**
```bash
npm install
```
**Start the development server**
```bash
npm run dev
```
**Opening  the app**
**Visit: http://localhost:3000** in your browser <br>
Keep the terminal window open while using the app (it shows logs)


## 🛠️ If npm (Node.js) is not installed on your system
Check if npm is installed <br>
Open a terminal (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and type: 
```bash
npm -v
```
If you see a version number (e.g., 9.0.0), npm is already installed. <br> 
If you see an error like “command not found”, then npm is not installed. <br> 
Install Node.js (includes npm)
Go to: https://nodejs.org/ <br> 
Download the LTS (Long Term Support) version (currently Node.js 18+). <br>
Run the installer (next → next → finish).<br> 
👉 This automatically installs Node.js and npm together.
Verify installation
After installing, reopen your terminal and run:
```bash
node -v
```
```bash
npm -v
```
You should now see version numbers for both. <br>


## 🤖 AI Components
The system integrates AI at multiple stages to improve efficiency and reliability:<br>
**Quotation Predictor (Scikit-learn + FastAPI)** <br>
Role: Predicts quotation prices instantly based on product type, size, colour, and quantity. <br>
Benefit: Provides sales staff with a quick, data-driven price estimate, cutting down manual calculation time.<br>

**LLM Fallback (GPT-4-mini)** <br>
Role: If the main prediction model is unavailable, the system uses a large language model to suggest approximate prices based on historical patterns and rules.<br>
Benefit: Ensures the system always provides a price suggestion, maintaining business continuity even if the ML predictor fails.<br>

**Quotation Summary (LLM – GPT-4-mini)** <br>
Role: Converts structured quotation data into clear, human-readable summaries.<br>
Example: “Quotation created for John Smith: 4 flush sash windows, estimated £1520.75.” <br>
Benefit: Improves communication between sales staff and management by simplifying technical details.<br>

✨ Together, these AI components make the system fast, reliable, and fault-tolerant — ensuring quotations are always generated, predicted, and clearly presented. <br>
